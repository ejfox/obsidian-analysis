# UMAP Visualization Project

UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is excellent for visualizing high-dimensional embeddings.

## Implementation

```python
import umap
import numpy as np

# Basic UMAP setup
reducer = umap.UMAP(
    n_neighbors=15,
    min_dist=0.1,
    n_components=2,
    metric='cosine'
)

# Fit and transform
embedding_2d = reducer.fit_transform(embeddings)
```

## Parameters
- **n_neighbors**: Controls local vs global structure
- **min_dist**: Minimum distance between points
- **metric**: Distance metric (cosine for text embeddings)

## Results
The visualization revealed clear clusters based on:
- Document topics
- Writing style
- Content type (code vs prose)

This is exactly what we needed for the embedding analysis! The clusters make semantic sense and the metadata coloring works perfectly.

## Next Steps
- Try different perplexity values
- Compare with t-SNE results
- Add interactive tooltips
