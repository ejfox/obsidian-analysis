# Neural Networks Deep Dive

Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information through weighted connections.

## Key Components

### Neurons
Each neuron receives inputs, applies weights, and produces an output through an activation function. The most common activation functions include:

```python
def relu(x):
    return max(0, x)

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + exp(-x))
```

### Layers
Networks are organized in layers:
- **Input layer**: Receives raw data
- **Hidden layers**: Process information 
- **Output layer**: Produces final results

## Training Process

Training involves adjusting weights to minimize loss. The backpropagation algorithm calculates gradients and updates weights iteratively.

Key questions to consider:
- How many hidden layers are optimal?
- What learning rate should we use?
- How do we prevent overfitting?

Modern architectures like transformers have revolutionized the field!
