# Daily Notes

## Morning Routine
- Wake up at 6 AM
- 30 minutes of reading
- Coffee and planning the day

## Work Focus Areas
Today I'm focusing on:
1. Finishing the embedding project
2. Reading papers on #attention-mechanisms
3. Code review for the team

## Reflection
What went well? The visualization pipeline is coming together nicely. The metadata enrichment approach is working better than expected.

What could improve? Need to spend more time on documentation. Also want to explore different chunking strategies.

## Links to Check
- [Attention paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
- Research on [[Transformer Architecture]]

Tomorrow: Start working on the clustering analysis!
